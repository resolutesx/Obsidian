##### Types of numbers

###### Natural Numbers (N)

Identified as "N"
N = {**0, 1, 2 , 3 , 4, 5, etc.**}
Developed back in ancient history
###### Integral Numbers (Z)

Identified as "Z"
Z = {**-5 ,-4, -3 ,-2 ,-1 , 0 ,1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5, etc.**}
Includes All Natural Numbers (N âŠ† Z) and negative numbers
###### Rational Numbers (Q)

Identified as Q
Any result that $$  \dfrac{ a  }{ b  }   $$$$b \neq 0
$$
Q = {  $$\frac{2}{3}
$$$$\frac{-5}{8}$$

##### Sets And Subsets

Example: ==A== = {**1 ,2 ,3 ,4**}
{**1, 2**} Is a subset of ==A==

Can contain words too ( {**red, green, blue**} )

We can say that a element is inside a set by $$2 \in A$$
Or if the element isn't in the set
$$2 \in A$$

##### Results And Decimals

###### Results
Always represented in a decimal form (**1 , 10, 0.5**)
<ins>Two Cases:</ins>
==I== = Results have a specific number of **0s**. Example: 0.==5== > 1 Zero, 0.==25== > 2 Zeros
==II== = Results have an infinite amount of 0s
